This project is about porting the default Android DownloadProvider.

Now it almost works,you can use eclipse to import it.

1.net.impjq.providers.downloads
This is the source code of the Android DownloadProvider,I have remove some code to make it work,such as DRM,MediaScanner and so on,but the core function is OK.

2.net.impjq.download
This is just a demo,you can refer to MyDownload to study how to use it.

3.some notes
IN DownloadNotification.java,search RemoteViews,you will see "net.impjq.download",this must be the Package Name,otherwise the Notification will not work correctly.

In Downloads.java,search CONTENT_URI,you can change "bookfm" to what you want,but don't change "/download",and also remember to change the AndroidManifest.xml:the authorities of the Provider.

If you need it,just enjoy it.
